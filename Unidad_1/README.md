"""Initial commit flavio
Whats is a distributed system?
Centralized system: state stored on a single computer
Simpler.
Easier to understand.
Can be faster for a single user.
Distributed system: State divided over multiple computers
More robust (can tolerate failures)
More Scalable (often supports many users)
more complex
Â¿Complexity is bad?
Complex systems can be less reliable!
Getting a distributed system right is hard
Getting them wrong can be bad
Because they are often important
Well worth using when their power is needed
 Examples
DNS
Distributed lookup table of hostname to ip address
Facebook and google
Massive scale
Fast enough
Very reliable
Email servers (SMTP)
